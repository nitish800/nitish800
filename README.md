## 🛡️ About Me

I'm a self-taught cybersecurity researcher with 5+ years of experience uncovering real-world vulnerabilities across the internet. My specialty lies in **exposure hunting** — scanning for misconfigured services, open directories, leaked credentials, and API keys using tools like **Shodan**, **ZoomEye**, and custom automation scripts.

Over the years, I’ve reported **500+ vulnerabilities**, with **200+ paid reports** across programs like **HackerOne**, **Bugcrowd**, and direct disclosures — including high-impact leaks at organizations like **CERN**, **mSpy**, and **Voxox**, covered in global media.

Outside security, I’ve built and published **7 Android apps** (500K+ downloads) with in-app purchases.
